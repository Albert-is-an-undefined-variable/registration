Notes to use github:

    before starting, always fetch latest stuff from the server:
    git pull

    When done with your work (and your life)
    git add .
    git commit -a -m "tell us what you did or cry ..."
    git push

    NOTE: when the stuff online changed while you worked on it, it can be that you cannot push your things directly.
    And you get this error:
    git push
    To https://github.com/Albert-is-an-undefined-variable/html
     ! [rejected]        proyect -> proyect (fetch first)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/Albert-is-an-undefined-variable/html'


    In that case, it opens a file with your local default editor program (for me that is vi) and asks me to write my commit message here.
    I need to do the following:

    1. press "i" (i for insert)
    2. write your merge message
    3. press "esc" (escape)
    4. write ":wq" (write & quit)
    5. then press enter



(To create a new branch)
    git branch thenameofthebranch

(To move to another branch)
    git checkout thenameofthebranch

(To know the branch you're in)
    git branch

(To be able to push you need to run )
    git push --set-upstream origin thenameofthebranch
